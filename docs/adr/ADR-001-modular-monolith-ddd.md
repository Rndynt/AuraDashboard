# ADR-001: Modular Monolith with Domain-Driven Design

**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Architecture Team  
**Technical Story:** Initial architecture decision for Dashboard Starter Kit

## Context

We need to choose an architectural approach for the Dashboard Starter Kit that balances several competing concerns:

1. **Development Speed**: Teams need to iterate quickly on features
2. **Maintainability**: Code should be easy to understand and modify
3. **Scalability**: Architecture should support growth without major rewrites
4. **Team Boundaries**: Multiple teams may work on different bounded contexts
5. **Operational Complexity**: We want to minimize deployment and monitoring overhead
6. **Learning Curve**: Architecture should be approachable for most developers

The project will implement a multi-tenant SaaS platform with complex business logic around identity, authorization, tenancy, and audit logging. These domains have clear boundaries but need to interact frequently.

## Decision

We will implement a **Modular Monolith** using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles with strict layer separation.

### Architecture Structure:
- **Single deployable application** (Next.js with API routes)
- **Bounded contexts** as separate modules under `packages/modules/`
- **Strict DDD layering** within each module:
  - `domain/` - Pure business logic, no external dependencies
  - `application/` - Use cases and application services
  - `infrastructure/` - Database repositories and external adapters
  - `interface/` - HTTP routes and UI components
- **Shared packages** for cross-cutting concerns (`core`, `db`, `auth`, `rbac`, `ui`)

### Module Structure Example:
